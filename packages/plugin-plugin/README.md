### Plan
not all of this may be in one package
* helpers for releasing 
> * mark supported yarn version (npm tag `yarn-2.3.1` for each version supported)
> * npm publishing
* downloading plugins from npm using tags to get the latest version that supports the end user's version of yarn
* same flow for release/download using npm but with git? some git ref(branch?) for latest source version of plugin?
* helpers for testing plugins on multiple yarn versions.
* helpers for managing dependencies

If you would like to help out with ideas or code use [this issue here](https://gitlab.com/Larry1123/yarn-contrib/-/issues/3).
